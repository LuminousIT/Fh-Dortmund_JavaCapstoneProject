Project Overview:
1.	Develop simulation of the Car charging station with several alternative sources of energy.
2.	Several car charging stations are available with n location in it. Only one car can be in one charging location. Charging one car takes a fixed time. If all places are occupied, the car will not wait for more than a certain time and will go to another car charging station.
3.	Simulate the weather conditions to log the situation at the charging station and switch between the energy sources.
4.	Simulate the management system for the energy sources.

Technologies Used:
- Java (Programming Language)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
